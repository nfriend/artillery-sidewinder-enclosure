# Artillery Sidewinder Enclosure

All the part definitions for my Artillery Sidewinder 3D printer enclosure.

## Details

This enclosure is a slightly modified vesion of [this IKEA Lack
enclosure](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/cheap-simple-3d-printer-enclosure_7785/).
The Sidewinder is too large to fit in the original IKEA Lack design, so this
version expands the enclosure slightly.

Here are the main differences between this enclosure and the enclosure linked
above:

- This enclosure does not use IKEA Lack tables. Instead, it uses two 24" x 30"
  boards for the top and bottom of the enclosure.
- Instead of IKEA Lack legs, it uses 2x2 boards; 30" tall for the main
  enclosure, and 24" tall for the feet.
